This is my Kitmap project, a practice PvP game that players can fight each other with a free kit

It includes features such as...
    - Koth
    - Unique and randomized Koth reward including MineZ legendaries and custom items, such as grapple.
    - Kit system by right clicking a sign at spawn
    - Spawn Tag
    - Kill/Death stats
    - Scoreboard displaying information such as kills, deaths, spawn tag timer, koth timer.
    - Custom death messages
    - Custom weapon damage
    - Other mechanics that help combat, such as removing empty bottle after drink a potion

I am planning to work on...
    - Scheduled, automated Koth event
    - Custom knockback
    - Better spawn enter blocker system when a player has a spawn tag
    - Killstreaks system and rewards based on it
    - Leaderboard
    - More MineZ legendaries and items as the original MineZ gets updated
    - New legendaries
    - Scheduled respawning loot chests and boss mobs
